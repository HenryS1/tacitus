* Tacitus 

Tacitus provides lazy immutable indexable ranges with optional
memoization. They support append in constant time, indexing in
constant time and a single (not appended) range requires close to zero
memory allocation. Appending ranges allocates memory for closures so
appending many small ranges gradually requires more memory.

** Usage

Create a range with ~between~.

#+begin_src lisp
TACITUS> (between 0 100)
#S(RANGE
   :SIZE 101
   :TRANSFORMATION #<CLOSURE (LAMBDA (I) :IN BETWEEN) {10039FA89B}>
   :MEMOIZATION NIL)
#+end_src

Convert a range to an array with ~to-array~.

#+begin_src lisp
TACITUS> (to-array (between 0 5))
#(0 1 2 3 4 5)
#+end_src

Transform a range with ~fmap~.

#+begin_src lisp
TACITUS> (to-array (fmap (lambda (n) (* n 3)) (between 4 8)))
#(12 15 18 21 24)
#+end_src

Append ranges with ~append-ranges~.

#+begin_src lisp
TACITUS> (to-array (append-ranges (between 7 9) (between 0 4)))
#(7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4)
#+end_src

Reduce ranges with ~reduce-range~.

#+begin_src lisp
TACITUS> (reduce-range #'+ (between 0 10))
55
#+end_src

Index into a range with ~index~.

#+begin_src lisp
TACITUS> (index (between 5 10) 0)
5
#+end_src

Ranges are space efficient.

#+begin_src lisp
TACITUS> (time (defparameter *big-range* (between 0 10000000)))
(time (defparameter *big-range* (between 0 10000000)))

Appending ranges is fast.

TACITUS> (time (append-ranges (between 0 10000000) (between 0 10000000)))
Evaluation took:
  0.000 seconds of real time
